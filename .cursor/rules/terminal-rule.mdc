- The terminal input field must always be rendered at the bottom of the terminal window, outside the scrollable output area.
- Only one input field should exist at a time.
- All command output goes into the scrollable area; the input is rendered in a fixed container at the bottom.
- Always check and enforce this rule before making any changes to terminal-related code.
